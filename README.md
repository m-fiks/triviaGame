# triviaGame

> This is a trivia game that was created for class.

### Goal of the game:

* The game begins when the player clicks the 'start' button.
* The game will display a trivia question and 3 choices the user can guess from.
* The player will click the choice they think is correct.
* Upon clicking, the game will then display if you guessed correctly or incorrectly.
* The player's score will be updated after answering each question.
* After learning if you were correct or not, the game will move on to the next question after 4 seconds. 
* The game also utilizes a timer that runs for 30 seconds on each question.
* If the timer runs out, it will be counted as an incorrect guess for the question.
* Once the player runs through all of the questions, they will be presented with their total score and the option to play again.


 This project was good practice in utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript timing events, and jQuery.
